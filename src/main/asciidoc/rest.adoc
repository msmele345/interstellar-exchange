== What is a RESTful API?

[[overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes
|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
The actual response will depend on the request method used.
In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `206 Partial Content`
| The server has processed the request but an error occurred that resulted in part
part of the request being fulfilled.  The server will return as much data as is currently available but some data may not be available at this time.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `401 Unauthorized`
| The request requires user authentication. The Header contains a key value pair of
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| `403 Forbidden`
| The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

| `500 Internal Service Error`
| The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

| `503 Service Unavailable`
| The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response.
